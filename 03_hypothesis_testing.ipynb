    "  - `cci` – consumer confidence index (annual average)\n",
    "  - `stress` – combined economic stress index (z-score of inflation and unemployment minus z-score of confidence)\n",
    "  - `d_sm` – year-to-year change in social-media participation (within country)\n",
    "- `panel_monthly_h3.csv` – country × year × month panel for H3 with:\n",
